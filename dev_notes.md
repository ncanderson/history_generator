# TODO

- Get defs on startup - who should own the data defs object, and should we give it generators on construction?

- rethink shared pointers everywhere, specifically how to handle generated history

- figure out what functions to make const

- Fix handling of config - child classes should get their own copy of their own config
- Modify instantiation of config, probably don't need it defined outside of main. Model it after data access manager
