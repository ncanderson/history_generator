# TODO

- make a separate constructor for the first deity, since everything will break down if they aren't attracted to anything
  - alternatively, in myth gen make some allowance for cthonic birth if the elder deity doesn't want to fuck

- Modify attributes. Calculate them in pairs, but then apply the values toe separate attrs. So create 'ATTRIBUTE_Cooperative_difficult', but then save cooperative and difficult separately

- figure out what functions to make const

- Fix handling of config - child classes should get their own copy of their own config, and not a single global config for everything

- figure out what the divine language looks like?

# Notes
Names. Modules wrapper? Single class that marshalls all the data modules? Then instan. that in the hist gen manager and pass to generators?

How to manage using names so we don't have tons of duplicates?

Right now just using a single names object in the myth generator
